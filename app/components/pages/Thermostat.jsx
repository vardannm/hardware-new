            The thermostat is designed to operate with standard HVAC systems. It
            offers two methods for user interaction and programming: through its
            built-in display and interface controls, over the Internet via web
            hosting. The thermostat operates using remote sensors that measure
            temperature and humidity. Even minor cosmetic enhancements
            introduced mechanical and electrical challenges, which were
            addressed and resolved during development. Additional features
            include a user interface with system status indicators, a
            self-diagnostics function for reliable operation across seasonal or
            climate changes, and integrated pressure sensors to detect open
            windows or possible duct damage. The thermostat is made up of a main
            unit and a backplate. The main unit includes the main processor and
            the user interface display, while the backplate provides connection
            with the HVAC system and represents the switching system. For
            switching, solid-state relays were used in pairs with overcurrent
            protection circuitry.

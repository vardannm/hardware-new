            The Moon project was designed to be the central home automation hub
            for a smart home system, bringing devices together in a seamless,
            intuitive way. From the start, our focus was on creating a system
            that was compact, efficient, and stable. To achieve this, we
            selected high-performance, low-power processors, advanced sensors,
            and a 360-degree HD camera to support security, automation, and
            environmental monitoring. The home automation controller also
            supported Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Z-Wave, making it compatible
            with a wide variety of devices. While the system was designed to be
            compact and efficient, integrating high-performance streaming
            hardware with a System on Module (SOM) required careful management
            of power and heat. This ensured smooth full-view video streaming
            while maintaining reliable performance for other smart home
            functions.
